          Hi, I'm Alana! I'm currently a junior studying Professional and Technical Writing at Virginia Tech. I'm incredibly passionate about writing, and one day, I hope to work in publishing or technical writing. I'm also double majoring in Creative Writing, and I hope to publish fiction stories for pre-teens and young adults. You can read about my relevant experience on the 'Resume' tab, but below you'll also find some information about me that might not come across in a formal resume...

          I've actually known that I was going to be a writer since the second grade. I remember sitting in the backseat of the minivan with my notepad and pen, dreaming up stories about kids lost in the woods or on the hunt for a thief. I decided that I was going to write chapter books about kids on their own, and funnily enough, my plan hasn't changed. I've always loved
          putting the young people in power. While the adults are off somewhere far from the action, the kids are fighting the monster and saving the world.

          As I've gotten older, I've kept my love for creative writing, but I've also found a passion for editing technical writing. I've learned how to take complex information and rephrase it in a way that's accessible to the average reader, and I've practiced taking long, confusing sentences and paring them down until they're clear and effective. I've learned how to analyze audiences and appeal to them in my own writing. I've also been able to help others with their writing through the VT Writing Center.
        </p>
        <p>
          While getting published is the ultimate goal, I intend to find a career in technical writing or publishing. While I'm still a year away from graduating, I'm beyond excited to asdf as a professional writer.
