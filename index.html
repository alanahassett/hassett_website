        <p> Hi, I'm Alana! I'm currently a junior studying Professional and Technical Writing
          at Virginia Tech. I'm incredibly passionate about writing,
          and one day, I hope to work in publishing or technical writing. I'm also
          double majoring in Creative Writing, and I hope to publish fiction stories for
          pre-teens and young adults. You can read about my relevant experience on the
          'Resume' tab, but below you'll also find some information about me that might not come across in a
          formal resume...</p>

      <div id="para2" class="paras">
        <p> I've actually known that I was going to be a writer since the second grade.
          I remember sitting in the backseat of the minivan with my notepad and
          pen, dreaming up stories about kids lost in the woods or on the hunt for a thief.
          I decided that I was going to write chapter books about kids
          on their own, and funnily enough, my plan hasn't changed. I've always loved
          writing about kids in power, off doing something important and incredible.
          I always wanted adults far from the action, leaving the kids to fight the monster
          and save the world. </p>

      <div id="para3" class="paras">
        <p> As I've gotten older, I've kept my love for creative writing, but I've also found a
          passion for editing technical writing. I've learned how to take complex information
          and rephrase it in a way that's accessible to the average reader, and I've practiced
          taking long, confusing sentences and paring them down until they're clear, concise,
          and meaningful. I've learned how to analyze audiences and appeal to them effectively
          in my own writing.
          I've also been able to help others with their writing through the
          VT Writing Center.
